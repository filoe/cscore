# CSCore - .NET Audio Library #

CSCore is a free .NET audio library which is completely written in C#. Although it is still a rather young project, it offers tons of features like playing or capturing audio, en- or decoding many different codecs, effects and much more!

CSCore is based on a very extensible architecture which allows you to make it fit to your needs without any major effort. You can build music players, voice chats, audio recorders and so on!

For more details, take a look at the source or the [online documentation](http://filoe.github.io/cscore/sharpDox/).

Feel free to download or clone the source code:
